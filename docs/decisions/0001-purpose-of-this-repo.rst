0001 Purpose of This Repo
#########################

Status
******

**Draft** (=> Provisional)

This ADR records several related decisions in one document because they were
settled together. Later detail goes in new ADRs that this one links to, not
in edits to this one in place.

Context
*******

Open edX has four search surfaces, three libraries, and no shared engine layer
between them.

* **Studio content search and the Libraries V2 UI** are served by
  ``openedx/core/djangoapps/content/search`` in ``openedx-platform``. It talks
  to Meilisearch directly and is gated on ``MEILISEARCH_ENABLED``. No other
  engine is supported.
* **LMS courseware search and course discovery** are served by ``edx-search``.
  Its README lists four engines: Meilisearch (preferred), Elasticsearch
  (deprecated), Typesense (beta, LMS only), and a mock used in tests.
* **Forum search** is served by ``openedx/forum``, which carries its own
  ``es.py``, ``meilisearch.py`` and ``typesense.py`` under ``forum/search/``.
* **Notes** are served by ``edx-notes-api``, which picks one of three backends
  from settings: Elasticsearch 7 through ``django-elasticsearch-dsl-drf`` (the
  default in its own settings), Meilisearch (``edx-notes-api#444``), and a
  MySQL fallback. Tutor has shipped the Meilisearch backend as the default
  since ``tutor-notes`` v19.0.0. That backend is thinner than the Elasticsearch
  one: it indexes only the note ``text`` and returns no highlighting.

Every one of those is a separate engine integration. An operator configures
each independently, and adding an engine means implementing it up to four
times. ``edx-search`` was meant to be the shared layer and is not: two of the
four surfaces were built outside it on purpose.

All four are in scope as adopters of this library. That is a stronger
commitment than "a better abstraction exists," and it is what makes retiring
Elasticsearch from the platform achievable rather than aspirational: a shared
layer that leaves one consumer behind leaves the engine behind it running.

How the platform arrived here
=============================

``edx-search`` used django-haystack as a cross-engine abstraction. As
``content/search``'s own ADR 0001 records, that "was ripped out after the
package was abandoned upstream and it became an obstacle to upgrades and
efficiently utilizing Elasticsearch (the abstraction layer imposed significant
limits)."

Removing haystack did not leave a neutral library behind. The ``edx-search``
API that remained, and the platform code calling it, stayed oriented around
Elasticsearch specifically. That is why ADR 0001 describes it as "a mix of
abstractions and direct usage of the Elasticsearch API," and it is the reason
adding a second engine to ``edx-search`` has been awkward rather than routine.

There was also a standing reason to get off Elasticsearch that has nothing to
do with licensing. It is resource-hungry even when idle: ADR 0001's own second
objection is that it "is very resource-intensive and often uses more than a
gigabyte of memory just for small search use cases." That, not licensing, was
the stated motivation when Tutor removed Elasticsearch from the whole
distribution in favour of Meilisearch, "which is much more lightweight in terms
of memory usage" (``overhangio/tutor#1141``). Any successor has to keep that
win.

That experience shaped what came next. When Meilisearch was adopted for Studio
search, it was adopted deliberately without an abstraction — but with the
expectation that one might be needed later. That ADR is explicit about it:
Decision 1 adopted Meilisearch "as an experiment and to evaluate it more
thoroughly," and Decision 3 committed to keeping "the Meilisearch-specific code
isolated to the new ``content/search`` Django app, so it's relatively easy to
swap out later if this experiment doesn't pan out." Its status is still
**Draft**. It was never accepted.

The isolation it asked for was largely achieved. Counting engine references
across the app: ``api.py`` holds 115 and is where essentially all engine
coupling lives; ``handlers.py`` has 21, of which 16 are the settings gate and
the rest are prose; ``documents.py`` has 17, all prose or key-slugging helpers;
``tasks.py`` has 16, of which 14 are ``MeilisearchError`` in retry handling —
the one piece of genuine coupling outside ``api.py``. ``views.py``,
``urls.py``, ``models.py`` and ``plain_text_math.py`` have two between them,
both prose.

Meanwhile ``openedx/modular-learning#245`` asked for exactly the layer this
repo is for: "prototype a search abstraction layer for content libraries,"
"prototype a Typesense backend," "refactor Meilisearch support to be a
backend." FC-0091 delivered Typesense backends to ``edx-search``, to
``forum``, and to the docs — but never to ``content/search``, and never as an
abstraction. The result is the split described above: Typesense is a supported
engine for LMS courseware search and forum search, and an unsupported one for
Studio.

Some of that work shipped incomplete rather than merely absent. The forum
Typesense backend was non-functional on every search — ``per_page`` set above
Typesense's hard cap of 250, and a topic filter naming a field the collection
schema does not declare. The fix is ``openedx/forum#289``, with end-to-end
tests against a real Typesense, since the existing tests mocked the client and
so could not observe a rejected request. This is worth stating in an ADR
because it is an argument about *where* engine support should live: a backend
that only one deployment exercises, tested only against a mock, will be broken
and nobody will know.

High availability, and where its licence landed
===============================================

``content/search``'s ADR 0001 gave as its first stated concern that Meilisearch
"doesn't (yet) support High Availability via replication, although this is
planned and under development." That has since been resolved, but not in a way
that helps an operator running the open-source stack.

Meilisearch now splits into two editions. Community Edition is MIT-licensed and
free. Enterprise Edition is licensed under BUSL-1.1 and ships as separate
binaries and Docker images (``getmeili/meilisearch-enterprise``). Replicated
sharding — the feature that answers that concern — requires Enterprise Edition
v1.37 or later. Self-hosted Community Edition still has no replication, and
therefore no high availability.

It is not only new capabilities that landed there. S3-streaming snapshots were
available in Community Edition and were reclassified as an Enterprise feature,
with CE 1.25–1.30 grandfathered. A capability that was open was withdrawn.

This matters more here than it would elsewhere, because it is the same problem
the platform moved to escape. That ADR's first stated objection to
Elasticsearch is that "in 2021, the license of Elasticsearch changed from
Apache 2.0 to a more restrictive license that prohibits providing 'the products
to others as a managed service'," which is "problematic for many Open edX
operators that use AWS and prefer to avoid any third-party services." The
specifics differ — this is a licence on the software rather than on reselling
it — but the position an operator ends up in is the same one, and an operator
who cannot or will not take a commercial licence is left where they started.

Typesense's clustering is not gated this way. It is GPL-3.0, and its
Raft-backed replication is part of the ordinary self-hosted product — the same
``typesense/typesense`` image, configured with a shared nodes file.

Meilisearch remains a good engine, and for a deployment that never needs
replication it remains a reasonable choice. The argument is not that one engine
should replace the other. It is that the platform should not oblige an operator
to run two engines, and that the answer to the platform's high-availability
question should not have to be a commercial licence.

One engine family
=================

The django-haystack history is the strongest objection to anything proposed
here, and it should be answered rather than waved past.

Haystack failed trying to span engines with genuinely different models —
Elasticsearch, Solr, Whoosh. Typesense, Meilisearch and Algolia are not that.
All three are Algolia-shaped document stores with closely parallel APIs:
documents in, ``filter_by``-style predicates, facet distributions, per-request
sort, and a locally-derived scoped credential that lets a browser query the
engine directly. Abstracting across them is a narrow problem, not a general
one. Elasticsearch and OpenSearch are the opposite case, and
``modular-learning#245`` already drew that line: the scope "would not try to
stretch to cover more traditional search engines like Elasticsearch, since
doing so would be much more work and present performance concerns."

That line is what keeps this from being haystack again.

Two of the three get implemented here. **Algolia is deliberately not built**,
because nobody has asked for it and there is no point paying to maintain a
backend with no user. What it gets instead is a guarantee that it stays cheap
to add: the interfaces and the frontend adapters are specified so that an
Algolia implementation is a backend someone contributes, not a redesign. An
interface that fits Typesense and Meilisearch should fit Algolia with no
further work, and on the frontend it is closer to free than that, because the
adapter layer described in Decision 8 *is* Algolia's client interface.

That matters more than a speculative third engine usually would. Algolia is
already spoken in parts of the estate — a code search across the ``openedx``
org returns several hundred files, and ``edx-enterprise``'s catalog search is
built on it — so if anyone does want it, it will be someone who already has it
running.

Feasibility, checked rather than assumed
========================================

A capability-by-capability review found no parity blocker between the two
engines. Each mapping below was executed against a running Typesense 30.2, not
inferred from documentation.

* ``distinctAttribute`` maps to ``group_by``; the ordered
  ``searchableAttributes`` list to ``query_by`` plus explicit
  ``query_by_weights``; ``sortableAttributes`` to per-field ``sort``; and the
  ``rankingRules`` entry that puts ``"sort"`` ahead of relevance needs no
  counterpart, because an explicit ``sort_by`` already outranks text matching.
* The ``create``/``swap_indexes``/``delete`` rebuild becomes a collection alias
  repoint, which is simpler and reclaims disk immediately.
* ``delete_documents(filter=...)`` maps to a ``filter_by`` delete.
* Browser-direct search survives. Typesense scoped search keys are the
  analogue of Meilisearch tenant tokens: an HMAC of a parent key over a rule
  carrying ``filter_by`` and ``expires_at``, derived locally with no API call.
  The embedded filter is enforced server-side — a key scoped to one
  organisation returns nothing for another's content rather than erroring.
* Task polling around every write disappears, because Typesense writes are
  synchronous.

**Multi-select hierarchical faceting works on Typesense.** This was the open
feasibility question, since the Studio tag tree is the one place the current
frontend uses Meilisearch's advanced APIs, and InstantSearch has never
supported multi-select hierarchical menus. ``fetchAvailableTagOptions()`` was
replicated against a real Typesense 30.2 using the document shape
``searchable_doc_tags()`` produces: 29 checks, all passing.
``searchForFacetValues`` maps to ``facet_by`` plus ``facet_query`` with
``per_page=0``; ``tags.taxonomy`` and ``tags.levelN`` map to nested ``string[]``
facet fields; multi-select maps to ``&&`` of ``tags.levelN:=`` terms.
Selections AND correctly across taxonomies and levels.

The part expected to be hard did not arise. Disjunctive faceting looked like
the obstacle and is not, because ``fetchAvailableTagOptions`` never passes the
tags filter into the tree query — only ``extraFilter``, the block-type filter
and the parent filter, so the tree is already computed without the current
selections applied.

Two respects where Typesense fits this UI better: the hard-coded
``meilisearchFacetLimit = 100`` that drives the "not all tags could be
displayed" warning has no equivalent ceiling (300 sibling tags returned in one
request), and because these are ordinary searches rather than a separate
endpoint, the level query and the ``hasChildren`` look-ahead batch into one
``multi_search`` instead of costing two round trips per node.

Two things that need care, neither blocking: shared-prefix siblings still need
the existing exact-parent post-processing, since ``Location > North America >
Canada`` also prefix-matches ``Canada Extra > Nowhere``; and filters must use
``:=`` rather than ``:``, which matches both.

This proves the query mechanics, not a working UI. Rendering and the client
seam are still real work. They are no longer unknown work.

Indexing performance
====================

Measured on one host, same documents, same index size, equivalent
configuration — only the ratios within a single run are meaningful, and the
absolute numbers are machine-specific:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - index size
     - Meilisearch 1.53.1
     - Typesense 30.2
   * - 50,000
     - 727 ms
     - 4 ms
   * - 150,000
     - 778 ms
     - 3 ms
   * - 300,000
     - 1044 ms
     - 6 ms
   * - 500,000
     - 1142 ms
     - 6 ms

The shape matters more than the ratio: Meilisearch's per-document cost rises
with index size, Typesense's stays flat. The Meilisearch figure is the queued
task's duration, which is what the current code blocks on; the Typesense figure
is a synchronous write, verified searchable immediately after the call returns.

This is context for ``openedx/openedx-platform#38993``, which is about the
indexing bottleneck itself. It is not an argument that one engine is better.
It is an argument that the API this repo exposes must not assume the
Meilisearch task-queue shape, because one of the supported engines has no task
queue at all and nothing to poll.

Decision
********

We will build ``openedx-search`` as the single search library for the Open edX
platform, replacing ``edx-search`` and the private engine layer inside
``content/search``.

1. **Use cases are registered, not hard-coded.** Studio courseware search,
   library search, learner courseware search, course discovery, forum search
   and notes search each register a use case that declares its document
   schema, index settings and query shape. Adding a surface does not mean
   writing another engine integration.

   Studio courseware and library content are listed separately on purpose.
   They share one ``studio_content`` index today, which is the direct cause of
   the scaling problem in ``openedx-platform#38993``: library writes are slow
   because the index is mostly course content. Splitting them is a use-case
   boundary, so registration is where it belongs.

2. **All four existing consumers are in scope as adopters:**
   ``content/search``, ``edx-search``'s consumers, ``openedx/forum`` and
   ``edx-notes-api``. Each adopts on its own schedule. The reason to name all
   four rather than start with the interesting ones is Decision 4: whichever
   consumer is left on Elasticsearch keeps Elasticsearch alive for everyone
   who runs it, so leaving one out forfeits the goal.

3. **Two engines are implemented: Typesense and Meilisearch.** Neither is a
   backend bolted on after the interface has been shaped around the other.
   Every use case must work on both.

   **Algolia is not implemented, but must stay adoptable.** No operator has
   asked for it, so building it now would be maintaining an unused backend.
   The commitment is narrower and more useful: the backend interface and the
   frontend adapter contract are designed so an Algolia implementation is an
   additive contribution. Anything that fits both engines above should fit
   Algolia without redesign, and the frontend adapter contract in Decision 8
   is Algolia's own client interface, so there it is nearly free.

4. **We do not carry Elasticsearch or OpenSearch forward, and the goal is to
   retire them from the platform entirely.** This is stronger than declaring
   them out of scope. ``edx-search`` still ships an Elasticsearch engine and
   ``edx-notes-api`` still defaults to one outside Tutor, so retirement is a
   migration with a defined end, not a deprecation notice. The engine-family
   boundary is what makes the abstraction narrow enough to survive, per
   ``modular-learning#245``.

   Doing this properly means filing a DEPR proposal for ``edx-search``, which
   can carry the Elasticsearch deprecation at the same time. That is a
   separate artefact from this ADR and a prerequisite for removing anything,
   not a consequence of merging this.

5. **Query and update filters are abstracted.** Callers build filter terms;
   backends render them. Today ``content/search`` leaks Meilisearch filter
   strings across app boundaries — ``modulestore_migrator``, for one, builds
   ``breadcrumbs.usage_key IN [...]`` by hand.

6. **Index lifecycle is managed, and managed the same way for every use
   case.** Creation, settings changes and rebuilds are versioned and applied
   like migrations, with one set of management commands across all use cases
   rather than per-surface commands that each know one engine.

   There is prior art to build on rather than repeat.
   `openedx-platform#36868 <https://github.com/openedx/openedx-platform/issues/36868>`_
   asked for this and is closed as completed: the Meilisearch configuration
   step now runs from a ``post_migrate`` hook rather than a manual command
   (`openedx-platform#38384 <https://github.com/openedx/openedx-platform/pull/38384>`_,
   with ``overhangio/tutor#1374`` alongside). That work was deliberately
   scoped to ``openedx-platform`` and left the ``edx-search`` refactor for
   later, which is this. It also settled a design question worth not
   relitigating: Django migrations run once, so schema changes cannot be
   expressed as migration files; the check has to run on every deploy and
   reconcile against the declared settings.

7. **Django stays out of the query path.** The browser queries the engine
   directly with a scoped, expiring credential minted locally. Proxying
   searches through the LMS to rewrite them would tie up worker threads for no
   gain, and has led to major performance issues on edx.org in the past.
   Minting scoped credentials is therefore part of the backend interface, not
   an engine-specific extra.

8. **The frontend abstracts at the InstantSearch client interface, using the
   existing adapters rather than a seam of our own.**
   ``typesense-instantsearch-adapter`` and ``instant-meilisearch`` become the
   concrete implementations, with React Query for state and Paragon for UI —
   which is what the Authoring MFE already uses, and which avoids pulling in
   the InstantSearch.js widget library.

   The distinction that makes this work: InstantSearch's *widgets* cannot do
   multi-select hierarchical facets, which is why ``search-manager`` was
   written by hand in the first place. Its *client interface* is a different
   thing, and that is all the adapters implement. Both provide
   ``searchForFacetValues``, the call the tag tree is built on;
   ``instant-meilisearch`` passes ``facetQuery`` and ``facetName`` straight
   through to the same Meilisearch method ``search-manager`` calls today. So
   the tag tree keeps its bespoke UI and loses only its bespoke transport.

   The payoff beyond not maintaining an abstraction: that interface is
   Algolia's, so Decision 3's "stays adoptable" costs nothing on the frontend.
   Swapping in ``algoliasearch`` is the Algolia implementation.

9. **No request-handling thread ever waits on an index write.** The earlier
   version of this decision said only that the API must not assume a task
   queue, which does not go far enough: choosing the synchronous engine is not
   a design, and an operator on Meilisearch would still be sleeping an LMS
   worker on a slow insert, which is exactly the problem reported in
   ``openedx-platform#38993``.

   So the API separates submitting a write from confirming it landed. Writes
   return once handed off. Waiting for durability is available but callable
   only from a worker, never from a request path, and for a synchronous engine
   it returns immediately because there is nothing to wait for. Batching is
   part of the write API rather than something each caller reinvents. What
   remains is a UI question rather than a threading one: how the browser
   learns the index caught up. That belongs with ``#38993``, and this
   interface has to leave room for whatever it concludes rather than assume
   the answer is a blocking call.

10. **Engine backends are verified against real engines, not mocks.** Both
    implemented engines run as containers in CI. This is a requirement, not a
    nicety: ``openedx/forum``'s Typesense backend shipped non-functional on
    every search because its tests mocked the client and so could not observe
    a rejected request (fixed in ``openedx/forum#289``). It is also a reason
    Algolia is a contribution rather than a deliverable here — being
    SaaS-only, with no official local emulator, it cannot be held to this
    standard, and a mocked backend is the failure mode this decision exists to
    prevent.

Consequences
************

1. An operator runs one search engine for the whole platform and picks which
   one. Today an operator who wants Typesense for courseware and forum search
   must also run Meilisearch for Studio.

2. Splitting ``studio_content`` into separate course and library indexes stops
   being a special-case fix and becomes ordinary use-case registration. It is
   being pursued now as a short-term mitigation for
   ``openedx-platform#38993``, ahead of this library, and the two do not
   conflict: whatever index topology lands there is expressible here. The
   frontend cost noted in that discussion, a multi-index request to keep
   "search all libraries and courses" working, is a ``multiSearch`` in the
   adapter interface rather than new machinery.

3. ``edx-search`` is superseded. It is not extended: its API mixes
   abstractions with direct engine usage, which is why ``content/search`` was
   built outside it. Migration is per-use-case, and both libraries will exist
   side by side while it happens.

4. ``content/search`` keeps its documents, its Celery tasks and its views, and
   loses its engine layer. Its ADR 0001's Decision 3 anticipated exactly this
   substitution.

5. Real engines must run in CI. Testing engine integrations against mocks is
   how the forum Typesense backend shipped broken on every search, so this is a
   requirement rather than a nicety. ``content/search``'s ADR 0001 deferred
   this deliberately — its Decision 5 was that "for the experiment, we won't
   use Meilisearch during tests, but we expect to add that in the future if we
   move forward with replacing Elasticsearch completely." This is that future.

6. The Authoring MFE's ``search-manager`` is written against the raw
   ``meilisearch`` JavaScript client, so it has to be rewritten against the
   InstantSearch client interface. This is still the largest single piece of
   work in the proposal, larger than the backend. What changed from the
   previous draft is that it is no longer *unbounded* work: the target
   interface exists, is maintained by both engine vendors, and does not have
   to be designed or kept alive by this project.

7. Result shapes differ and the adapters absorb most of it, but not all.
   Typesense returns ``grouped_hits`` where Meilisearch's
   ``distinctAttribute`` returns flat ``hits``. Highlighting does not map
   exactly: Typesense decides per field whether to snippet and how much
   context to keep, where Meilisearch crops to a token count per attribute.
   Result cards need a visual pass, not a rename. Where the adapters normalise
   these, that is a reason to use them rather than something to re-solve.

8. Some engine differences cannot be abstracted away and must be surfaced
   honestly rather than papered over. Three found while building a Typesense
   schema for the Studio documents, recorded so they are not rediscovered
   painfully:

   * A ``content\..*`` string wildcard field, the pattern ``edx-search`` uses,
     rejects the array sub-fields container documents carry. Explicit
     ``string[]`` overrides must precede the wildcard.
   * ``max_facet_values`` defaults to 10 and also caps the reported total, so a
     truncated facet list is not detectable from the response. Every faceted
     request must set it explicitly. Meilisearch's equivalent defaults to 100.
   * Maximum hits per request differ sharply — Meilisearch 1000, Typesense 250 —
     so anything that pages must take its page size from the backend rather
     than assume one.

9. ``edx-notes-api`` already has a Meilisearch backend, but it is precedent
   for the transport, not for the behaviour: it dropped tag search and
   highlighting rather than porting them. Its document is small and maps
   cleanly — nine flat fields, keyword search over ``text`` and ``tags``,
   filters on ``user``, ``course_id`` and ``usage_id``, ordering by
   ``-updated`` — but three things in the Elasticsearch backend do not carry
   across, and the last of them is an API contract:

   * It declares custom Elasticsearch analyzers. ``html_strip`` combines the
     ``html_strip`` char filter with lowercase, stop-word and snowball
     stemming filters; ``case_insensitive_keyword`` is a keyword tokenizer
     plus lowercase. Neither target engine exposes an analyzer chain.
     Stripping HTML has to move to index time, and stemming behaviour becomes
     the engine's rather than ours. Relevance will differ; this needs
     acceptance, not a parity claim.
   * ``number_of_fragments: 0`` means "highlight the whole field, do not
     snippet." Both engines can be configured to return a fully highlighted
     field, but neither does so by default.
   * The highlight markers ``{elasticsearch_highlight_start}`` and
     ``{elasticsearch_highlight_end}`` are part of the response contract that
     edxapp consumes. Both engines support custom highlight tags, so the
     markers can be preserved exactly — but they have to be configured
     deliberately, and the name will be a lie once Elasticsearch is gone.
     The existing Meilisearch backend does not emit them at all, so a
     deployment on it today already gets unhighlighted results.

Open Questions
**************

* **Which engine is the default?** Both are supported either way; the default
  only decides what a new deployment gets without choosing. The case for
  Meilisearch is that Typesense holds its entire index in memory, roughly two
  to three times the size of the searchable fields, where Meilisearch can
  serve an index larger than RAM. That is a real operating cost at scale, and
  it points at Meilisearch as the default provided the indexing fixes in
  ``openedx-platform#38993`` land. Small deployments are unlikely to notice
  either way. This ADR does not need to settle it, and the settings interface
  should make it an operator's choice rather than a hard default.
* **Should Studio courseware search and learner courseware search share one
  index?** They are separate use cases in Decision 1 because they are separate
  today, not because they must be. Consolidating them may be worth doing, and
  the answer changes what registration looks like for both.
* **Who does each consumer's migration?** The order is decided:
  ``content/search`` goes first, because it is the hardest case and a library
  that handles it will handle the simpler ones, whereas starting simple risks
  discovering the API shape is wrong after it is public. It also delivers the
  motivating outcome soonest, letting an operator run Typesense alone.
  ``edx-notes-api`` is last. It already has a path off Elasticsearch through
  its own Meilisearch backend, so ending the retirement there is a DEPR on its
  Elasticsearch backend, not a dependency on this library. Who picks up each
  piece is not decided.

Rejected Alternatives
*********************

Re-architect ``edx-search`` in place
====================================

The obvious option, and what ``edx-search#245`` originally proposed. Rejected
because the useful outcome is a clean surface rather than a compatible one, and
because the existing package carries an Elasticsearch integration, a deprecated
engine, and an API that ``content/search`` was deliberately built to avoid. A
new package can be adopted use case by use case; a rewrite in place cannot.
The name is worth preserving as a redirect, not the code.

Leave each surface with its own engine layer
=============================================

The status quo. It is genuinely cheaper per change and has no abstraction risk.
Rejected because it multiplies every engine decision by four, and because the
forum Typesense backend demonstrates what happens to an integration that only
one deployment exercises.

Support one engine only
=======================

The simplest possible answer, and the one that requires no abstraction at all.
Rejected whichever engine is picked.

Meilisearch alone makes the platform's high-availability story depend on a
BUSL-1.1 licence, which is the same failure mode the move off Elasticsearch was
meant to avoid. Typesense alone forces a change on every operator currently
running Meilisearch, to solve a problem only some of them have. Either way the
platform would be back to one vendor's licensing decisions being everyone's
problem, which is the condition that produced this ADR.

Supporting more than one engine is the price of not doing that to either group,
and the cost is bounded because they are the same shape.

Implement an Algolia backend now
================================

An earlier draft of this ADR listed Algolia as a third implemented engine.
Rejected because no operator has asked for it, so it would mean carrying a
backend with no user, and because it cannot be verified the way the other two
can: being SaaS-only, with no official local emulator, it cannot run in CI, and
a mocked backend is how ``openedx/forum``'s Typesense support shipped broken.

What survives from that draft is the part with actual value, in Decision 3:
Algolia has to stay cheap for someone else to add. An interface that fits two
Algolia-shaped engines should fit a third, and on the frontend the adapter
contract is Algolia's own client interface, so that direction costs nothing to
keep open.

Build our own frontend abstraction layer
========================================

Also from an earlier draft of this ADR, which proposed an "engine-agnostic
client seam, shipped with this library." Rejected in favour of the
InstantSearch client interface and the vendors' existing adapters, per
Decision 8. Writing one is not the hard part; keeping it working against two
engines' release cycles is, and the adapters are already maintained by the
people who ship those engines.

The reason this looked necessary was a conflation worth stating plainly, since
it is the whole reason ``search-manager`` exists in its current form:
InstantSearch's *widgets* cannot do multi-select hierarchical facets, and its
*client interface* has nothing to do with that limitation. Only the second is
being adopted.

Implement search logic on the backend and proxy from the LMS
============================================================

Clean, and it would remove the frontend problem entirely. Rejected on

Worth revisiting if the platform adopts asyncio Django.
